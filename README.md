# Learning EDA from Scratch: A Beginner's Notebook

This is a beginner-friendly notebook where I practiced Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python.  
The goal was to understand EDA step-by-step in a hands-on, fun, and understandable way and to help other beginners do the same.
